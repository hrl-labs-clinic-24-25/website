## Hardware

The hardware consists of four main components. Each plays a role in interfacing with the system enclosure, signal routing, or I/O operations:

### 1. System Enclosure
- **Rack Box**: Link to the rack box we order
- **Custom Front Panel**: [Front Panel](#sec-custom-panels)
- **Assemble Picture**:
