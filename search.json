    "text": "First, Some Acknowledgements\nHRL Laboratories sponsored our clinic experience, with the quantum researchers Andrew Oriani, Paul Jerger, and Abbie Wessels overseeing our project from start to finish. These three expert liaisons gave us valuable insight into their laboratory work, guided the direction of our work, offered earnest and thoughtful feedback, and generally helped us develop a successful product. The student team extends our most sincere gratitude to HRL’s experts for providing us with this opportunity!\nAdditionally, Harvey Mudd pairs the student team with an advisor from the college. Professor Joshua Brake served as our team’s advisor, supporting us with his wealth of knowledge in electrical engineering and team dynamics. His guidance and probing technical questions were essential to the successful execution of our project, and we thank him greatly for his help!\nFinally, our team would like to thank the others who helped us along the way. Thank you to Sho Uemura, who’s expert guidance through the QICK firmware and Vivado software helped our team over several hurdles. Thank you also to the staff and faculty in Harvey Mudd’s engineering department, who helped keep our clinic experience afloat with equipment and administrative services.\nWe hope you enjoy the QUACK box, and its many quirks. It is a first-ever prototype, after all. QUACK!"

So, using either a hole-saw, laser cutter, water jet, or (in our case) a metal hole punch, clear a Coupling PCB-sized hole into the stock panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Our modified stock back panel. Note: the current Support Panel design has been slightly shrunk in the vertical direction, so the corner mounting holes will not extend into the top and bottom flange areas. This change is not pictured above.\n\n\n\nWe found it most effective to use the actual support panel and Coupling PCB, alongside a Sharpie, to mark where the mounting holes should be drilled and the panel should be knocked out.

Any less than this may indicate a short between the power and ground terminals, and the board should not receive power.\nFollow the Input Rack assembly instructions below to connect up the ribbon cables and lead/follow selectors. Repeat the ohmmeter power test described above.\nTo this functionally assembled input board rack (even if not screwed together), connect up all of the power cables to the input coupling board. Testing the Molex 6-pin power connector, repeat the ohmmeter power test.\nEnsure that the pins of your power supply match the expected inputs of the Molex 6-pin power connector.

These features can be enabled by soldering a jumper pad on the back of the CN0531 cards. Specifically, our system requires following feature:\n\nLDAC. Bridge/connect P14.\n\nThis feature allows for the DACs to receive a new data transmission without actually updating the DAC output yet. Thus, multiple DACs can asynchronously receive the data transmissions for their next value, but all update synchronously with a pulse of LDAC.\nResearchers may, however, also make use of the following two features. They are not yet built for native support on the qick-quack package, but are described in brief detail below. See the AD5791 datasheet available here for more information on these signals.\n\nCLR. Bridge/Connect P15. Not built into qick-quack.\n\nCLR control is not built into the qick-quack package. However, a researcher may find that it comes in handy. The DACs have a CLR register, and pulsing the CLR line will set a DAC’s output to this CLR value. In this way, the entire system can set to a known state without having to manually send all 32 of these clear messages. Sending a custom SPI message in Mode 3 (config mode) could allow a user to experiment with this feature.\n\nRESET. Bridge/Connect P16. Not built into qick-quack.\n\nRESET control is not built into the qick-quack package, but can be accessed in Mode 3 (config mode). This feature may be similarly useful to researchers. Pulsing this line low resets the entire DAC setup to it’s power-on status. Note that, after use, all DACs will need to be reconfigured."

Again, see the manual that came along with the stock enclosure for more on this—we followed the same process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Back Panel – Exploded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Back Panel – Assembled, Interior\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.4: Output PCB Attachment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Output PCBs – Exploded\n\n\n\nMake sure you have collected the above materials – 4 output boards, 12 long 16.00mm M3 screws and matching nuts, and 16 long 5.20mm nylon spacers (MNI-4-10).

It is missing the top panel—leave it off while you complete the following steps. Further, make sure that you still have not assembled the two screws that go into the middle of the side panels, into the bottom panel. Here, we have replaced the stock enclosure short screws with 16.00mm long M3 screws and nuts. These will be used to help attach the input board stack-up to the enclosure securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Finished Enclosure"

    "section": "Input Board Stack-Up",
    "text": "Input Board Stack-Up\nTurning now to the right half of the full exploded view (Figure 4), lets assemble the input board stack. To do so, you’ll need 4 input boards with a 2-pin jumper for each. To structurally stack them up, you’ll need 6 M3 nuts, 18 M3 PCB standoffs, and 6 M3 short 6.00mm screws.\nNote that we have labelled each of the boards we received with a masking tape number. This helps with tracking which boards have been tested, according to the system outlined above in Preparation – Electronics Defect Testing. It also helps to track future errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Input Boards, Structural Stacking Elements, and Jumpers\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we have created the following 3D printed support system, designed to center the input board stack within the enclosure, and to keep it from knocking around inside the box. Note that only the rectangular units on the upper left and right are required for this function, but we will show our construction with the full bottom support in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Printed Support – Exploded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Printed Support – Assembled\n\n\n\nAlso, have your ribbon cables on hand.\n\nStep 2.1: Bottom layer\nAssembling the bottom layer takes the most care—the upper layers are more standardized. Begin by securing 4 standoffs in the corners of one of your boards. PCB standoff through the top, nut to secure on the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Bottom Layer – Edge Standoffs\n\n\n\nPlace this assembly on top of your 3D printed supports. Make sure that, if you have the full bottom panel, the DAC slots are aligned with the DAC pmod ports on the input board. Attach these 4 standoffs to the corners with a second set of 4 M3 nuts. There should now be 8 nuts screwed on the 4 standoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Bottom Layer – Back with only Edge Standoffs\n\n\n\nNext, attach the middle two PCB standoffs and screw these in as well, using two M3 nuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Bottom Layer – Middle Standoffs Going In\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27: Bottom Layer – Secure Middle Standoffs\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.2: Secure To Enclosure\nPlace your bottom layer in the enclosure. Use the leftover screws from earlier in the enclosure process, described in the Finished Enclosure section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28: Bottom Layer in Enclosure – Exploded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: Bottom Layer in Enclosure – Assembled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Bottom Layer in Enclosure – Close-Up\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.3: Designate Leader or Follower\nWorth calling out as it’s own step—the entire system will not work if the user does not designate each and every board as either a “leader”, connecting to the FPGA-In connector, or a “follower”, connecting to the Daisychain-In connector.\nBy default, neither connection is enabled. The board will only receive a valid input from the mutually exclusive connectors once one of the two pins has been jumped using the 2-pin jumper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: Jumper (set to follower on the bottom layer)\n\n\n\nIf a user wanted to only use up to 8 DACs, then they would connect this pin to the FPGA-In side and connect the FPGA-In connector up to the coupling board. However, we are assuming here a system of up to 32 DACs, and so we plan to build 3 more layers on top of this bottom layer. Thus, we will designate this board as a “follower”, connecting the jumper between the GND center pin and the Daisychain side.\n\n\nStep 2.4: Add Second Layer\nUsing 6 standoffs and another board, add to the stack!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 32: Second Layer Added\n\n\n\nMake sure to designate this board as a follower, the same as you did to the bottom layer.\nIn order to electrically connect the two layers, take one of your 3 Daisychain cables and attach it from the top board’s Daisychain Out to the bottom board’s Daisychain In, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: First Daisychain Cable, assuming that the bottom layer is the terminating board (end of daisychain).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.5: Repeat for Third Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: Third Layer Added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Second Daisychain Cable, assuming that the bottom layer is the terminating board (end of daisychain).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.6: Add Fourth Layer\nThis step differs slightly. Instead of using PCB standoffs to secure the top layer, we will instead use the short 6.00mm M3 screws to tighten into the existing standoffs rising from the third layer.\nAlso, this layer gets the designation of leader board, connecting the jumper to the FPGA-In side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: Final Fourth Layer Added\n\n\n\nNote that the jumpers should look like this, going down the line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: All Jumper Arrangements (bottom 3 red are Daisychain “followers”, top is FPGA-In “leader”).\n\n\n\nFinally, add in the third and final daisychain connector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: All Daisychain Cables Connected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 39: Fully Assembled Input Board Stack.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.7: Add Power and FPGA-In Cable\nTaking the last and special FPGA-In ribbon cable, attach it between the leader board on the stack and the coupling board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 40: FPGA-In Cable Added\n\n\n\nNext, connect a Molex Microfit 2-pos Power Cable between every individual input board and the coupling board. The coupling board has 4 Microfit connectors for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41: Power Cable Attached. Note: Only one is shown."

    "text": "Adding DACs\nOne may attach any amount of 1-32 DACs into this system. It is recommended that you begin filling the system from the bottom, and build your way up. Each DAC must first be connected with a Adafruit 261: JST 2-Pin Cable Assembly. Connect the red leads to the middle screw terminal port, the Vout. Connect the black lead to the GND left screw terminal port. Shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42: Wiring of a single DAC\n\n\n\nSome users may prefer to instead twist the cables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 43: Twisted Output Wire\n\n\n\nHowever you attach it, and whichever pmod header on the Input Board Stack you choose to plug this DAC into, just make sure that you plug the output cable into the output board SMA port which is directly across from that pmod slot. Match the 4x8 grid of pmod headers to the 4x8 grid of output board SMA ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 44: DAC Plugged In\n\n\n\nWith that, you’re done! You can slap on the rack mounting flanges that came with the stock enclosure, and attach the top panel. Before you do so, best practice is to test and debug as many signals as you can. We wish you the best of luck with your QUACK box!"
