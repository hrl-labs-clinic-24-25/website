Welcome to the QUACK box user website! Here, you'll find information on creating and using your own QUACK box.

What is a QUACK box? It is a modular and scalable voltage control system that's optimized for quantum experimentation. Software and Firmware control is built from and compatible with the open-source QICK system. The qick-quack package allows users to use the QUACK box to natively generate custom calibration PvP plots, and offers full setting and PvP control of up to 32 DAC channels.
