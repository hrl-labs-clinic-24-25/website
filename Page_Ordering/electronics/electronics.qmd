## Overview

In this project, we designed three custom PCB:

- A **input board**
- A **output board**
- A **coupling board**

All of our custom PCB were ordered through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)

## PCB Fabrication Files

Here are the links to our PCB fabrication files:

- [Input Board](https://github.com/hrl-labs-clinic-24-25/hardware-fabrication/tree/main/Input_Board)
- [Output Board](https://github.com/hrl-labs-clinic-24-25/hardware-fabrication/tree/main/output_board)
- [Coupling Board](https://github.com/hrl-labs-clinic-24-25/hardware-fabrication/tree/main/coupling_board)

Each link contains three neccessary files for ordering the PCB:

- **Gerber Files**: These files contain the information needed to manufacture the PCB, including the copper layers, solder mask, and silkscreen.
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: This file lists all the components required for the PCB, including their specifications and quantities.
- **CPL (Centroid File)**: This file provides the coordinates of each component on the PCB, which is essential for automated assembly processes.

## PCB Ordering Instructions throgh JLCPCB
1. Go to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) and create an account if you don't have one. *Note: you ust have an account to place an order.*
2. Sign in to your account

4. Then it will show the options for selecting the PCB specifications, such as size, quantity, and color. We recommended using the these following options:
   - Choose Plugged for Via Covering

   - Choose "Standard" PCB. 

   *Note: if you have a two layer PCB, you **have** to choose "Standard" and assemble "Both Sides"*

8.  Continue to the next step by clicking "Next"

*Note: It's Ok that your part are not align well, the there will be engineer from JLCPCB contact you (email) fix the alignment and confirm the PCB design with you*
