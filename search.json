Then, follow the instructions in the image below to customize your panel design. \n\n*Notes: Material of your choice [To Do: explain different material choice]\n\nOn the top toolbar, you can choose to drill a hole, add a cutout, or insert a text label. The images below demonstrate how to add a hole and a label.\n\n  \n\nUse the measure tool to check the dimensions/position of the holes and cutouts. The images below show how to use the measure tool\n\n\n\n\nPanel Design Instructions 5\n\n\nNote: I recommend measuring at specific points such as Edges (E), Center of Hole (R), or Midpoint (M) — these indicators will appear when you hover over them. If no indicator pops up, the measurement may not be exactly at the desired point.\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the design, go to Order → Order Panel. This will direct you to the Front Panel Express ordering site to place your order. You can choose to order the panel as is or download the design file for future use."
