The QUACK box is the product of a group of students from Harvey Mudd College, working within what's called a "Clinic" team — clinic is like a capstone experience for Harvey Mudd engineers. 

## First, Some Acknowledgements

HRL Laboratories sponsored our clinic experience, with the quantum researchers Andrew Oriani, Paul Jerger, and Abbie Wessels overseeing our project from start to finish. These three expert liaisons gave us valuable insight into their laboratory work, guided the direction of our work, offered earnest and thoughtful feedback, and generally helped us develop a successful product. The student team extends our most sincere gratitude to HRL's experts for providing us with this opportunity!

Additionally, Harvey Mudd pairs the student team with an advisor from the college. Professor Joshua Brake served as our team's advisor, supporting us with his wealth of knowledge in electrical engineering and team dynamics. His guidance and probing technical questions were essential to the successful execution of our project, and we thank him greatly for his help! 

Finally, our team would like to thank the others who helped us along the way. Thank you to Sho Uemura, who's expert guidance through the QICK firmware and Vivado software helped our team over several hurdles. Thank you also to the staff and faculty in Harvey Mudd's engineering department, who helped keep our clinic experience afloat with equipment and administrative services.

We hope you enjoy the QUACK box, and its many quirks. It is a first-ever prototype, after all. QUACK!

      <p>Lucas appreciated designing and testing creative solutions to the SPI demultiplexing problem. There's few satisfactions in EE greater than holding the freshly fabbed PCB you've poured hours of labor into. Lucas is entering his senior year focusing on electronics hardware and embedded systems.</p>
