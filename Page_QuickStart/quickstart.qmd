title: Quack Start
---

# TL;DR
You will need the following items to correctly summon the QuACK. For more information on each step, see the Detailed Instructions tab above.

- [ ] **1 working qick setup** including RFSoC, RFSoC accessories and software
- [ ] 2 to 32 CN-0531 DAC boards
- [ ] 1 to 4 QuACK input boards
- [ ] 1 to 4 QuACK output boards
- [ ] 1 QuACK coupling board
- [ ] 1 6V power supply
- [ ] 1 qickquack installation
- [ ] Advanced power tooling
- [ ] Beginner-friendly screwdriver
- [ ] A fair bit of time
- [ ] Some patience
- [ ] Stale bread (quantity varies)
 

## Hardware

The hardware consists of four main components. Each plays a role in interfacing with the system enclosure, signal routing, or I/O operations:

### 1. System Enclosure
- **Rack Box**: Link to the rack box we order
- **Custom Front Panel**: [Front Panel](#sec-custom-panels)
- **Assemble Picture**:

### 2. Input Board Stack
- **Function**: 
- **Key Components**: 
- **PCB Info**: Link to the PCB design that we documented in the website
  - Designed in Kicad
  - Power: 
  - any notes that user might need when they try to figure out stuff(frequency/current) , datasheet-like style
- **Mechanical Support Design**: link to the mechanical support
- **Assemble Picture**: Provide a picture of 4 stack of input board

### 3. Output Board
- **Function**: 
- **Key Components**: BOM of output board
- **Mechanical Support Design**
- **PCB Notes**: Link to the PCB design that we documented in the webiste
  - Two layer PCB board

### 4. Coupling Board
- **Function**: A two layer PCB board to offer a reliable and convience way to rout power and data through the enclosure to the internal elecrical system.
- **Key Components**:
  - Primary Board:
    - Micro-Fit 3.0 Vertical Header for power output
    - 2 x 12 pin Male IDC connector for data output
    - 6 pin Mini-Fit Jr. Vertical Header for power input
    - 25 position D Sub connector for data input
  - Secondar Board: 
    - 25 position D Sub connector
    - 2 x 12 pin female'
- **Mechanical Design**

## Software
QuACK expands on both the firmware and software aspects of QICK. 

If you are content to use what we have provided (which should definitely be your starting place if you're just checking it out the first time), the two files you **need** are `quack.bit` and `quack.hwh`. If you want to edit the QuACK firmware, go you, because that's an advanced operation. See the Advanced Usage tab. 

The software upgrades provided by QuACK are all contained in the `qickquack` package. You can use `pip install qickquack` to check it out on your laptop, but you'll need to follow the instuctions in Detailed Instructions > Installation if you want it on the RFSoC (the only place it's actually useful fyi).
